# Monitor System Resources Using Netdata

By Guru Sahib Ji's grace tried to learn above task running netdata docker container and then visualizing the netdata installed on localhost at port 19999. Moreover, visualize the metrics related to cpu, disk, memory, check for alerts and try to add chart panels. Later tried to open the logs, all try to cover in the screenshots.

thanks
